# llm-d-modelservice

**ModelService** is a Helm chart that simplifies LLM deployment on llm-d by declaratively managing Kubernetes resources for serving base models. It enables reproducible, scalable, and tunable model deployments through modular presets, and clean integration with `llm-d` ecosystem components (including vLLM, Gateway API Inference Extension, LeaderWorkerSet). It provides an opinionated but flexible path for deploying, benchmarking, and tuning LLM inference workloads.

The ModelService Helm Chart proposal is accepted on June 10, 2025. Read more about the roadmap, motivation, and other alternatives considered [here](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d/blob/dev/docs/proposals/modelservice.md).

TL;DR:

Active scenarios supported:
- P/D disaggregation
- Multi-node inference, utilizing data parallelism
- One pod per node (see [`llm-d-infra`](https://github.com/llm-d-incubation/llm-d-infra/tree/main/quickstart/examples/wide-ep-lws) for the ModelService [values](https://github.com/llm-d-incubation/llm-d-infra/tree/main/quickstart/examples/wide-ep-lws/ms-wide-ep/values.yaml) file)
- One pod per DP rank

Integration with `llm-d` components:
- Quickstart guide in `llm-d-infra` depends on ModelService
- Flexible configuration of `llm-d-inference-scheduler` for routing
- Features `llm-d-routing-sidecar` in P/D disaggregation
- Utilized in benchmarking experiments in `llm-d-benchmark`
- Effortless use of `llm-d-inference-sim` for CPU-only workloads

## Getting started

Add this repository to Helm.

```
helm repo add llm-d-modelservice https://llm-d-incubation.github.io/llm-d-modelservice/
helm repo update
```

ModelService operates under the assumption that `llm-d-infra` has been installed in a Kubernetes cluster, which installs the required prerequisites and CRDs. Read the [`llm-d-infra` Quickstart](https://github.com/llm-d-incubation/llm-d-infra/tree/main/quickstart) for more information.

Note that in order to create HTTPRoute objects last, Helm hooks are used. As a consequence, these objects are not deleted when `helm delete` is executed. They should be manually deleted to avoid unexpected routing problems.

## Examples

See [examples](/examples) for how to use this Helm chart. Some examples contain placeholders for components such as the gateway name. Use the `--set` flag to override placeholders. For example,

```
helm install cpu-only llm-d-modelservice -f examples/values-cpu.yaml --set prefill.replicas=0 --set "routing.parentRefs[0].name=MYGATEWAY"
```

Check Helm's [official docs](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/) for more guidance.
